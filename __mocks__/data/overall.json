There are a lot of issues where foreigners like myself are driving up the rent and we are solely blamed for this. The larger issue here is the Portuguese government is not using these tourism dollars towards their people. I'm staying in Alfama and there is 'fuck tourists' spray painted in a few places but in order to come and stay here we are being asked to provide our information and the government is well aware of this. I would urge the Portuguese to not solely be angry at foreigners for this. We are only doing what is allowed. I think it's a mostly beautiful city but it very expensive for locals and it's very pricey for tourists as well. Alfama area has a lot of mold everywhere. I can see mold on the outside of some of these buildings. Not enough people are discussing the mold issues that a lot of these apartments and rentals have. The older homes have no insulation and heat and the inside of the homes are very cold. Colder than outside. The locals haven't been friendly to me as other reviews have suggested. I completely understand why they are not nice. After visiting here, I can't consciously tell someone to go to Portugal and stay there long term. I'm even having a moral dilemma after being here for 3 weeks. ",

People are very nice here but expect general life for the locals to revolve around tourism. You're not going to get an authentic Indonesian cultural experience. It's definitely not perfect and not an easy place to live but considering how cheap it is what can you expect? I think the pros outweigh the cons and cons are plentiful (dirty, cash society, scams, busy vs gorgeous weather, great expat/dm community, cheap, lots to see/eat/do). Did I mention it's cheap??",

Almost everyone I met has horror stories about being robbed at gunpoint, robbed by the police, and in one case even drugged and robbed by a taxi driver. It's not even safe to walk a short distance at night (locals told me to just take Uber). Beyond the security issues, scams also abound, and the covid policy is wacky, with hand sanitizer being forced on you everywhere you go (watch out: many of these products from Mexico contain toxic ingredients according to the FDA). Prices are similar to in Europe, yet security is much worse. In my book, that's a bad deal. I don't see myself spending much time here in the future.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Bengaluru, January  4-9, and 13-13, 2020.  Had a good time in Bengaluru ( formerly Bangalore). At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes.  Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food.  The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window.  In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :).  Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there).  Now, lets talk about  traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore.   Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty...  You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you.  I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.   My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) .  Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy.  I will return to Bengaluru in the future.",

Lagos is getting more and more interesting as a DN-hub and also a place to reside long term as an expat. A growing number of expats are making Lagos their permanent residence, building a vibrant community. A great alternative to Lisbon IMO, close to other nice spots in Algarve + Spain.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I wanted to share my experience as it's unlike any I've heard prior to my arrival. I've been in Cape Town for a month now and as a 24 yo woman traveling with 2 other friends I must say that I have never felt so unsafe. I stay in waterfront/ green point which are relatively very safe neighborhoods, yet I  get stalked every day, both my friends have been robbed in a safe area around lunch time. We have to really watch out where we're walking and what we're wearing. I'd say the crimes are very easily avoided if you take an uber everywhere so you can go from your house to the beach by car, than from your house to table mountain by car etc. I'd say that looks do matter, as 3 tall slim blond girls we're probably the worst demographic to go here. Also if we walk together there are no issues at all, yet walking alone is not really an option. With the exception of a couple streets you can sort-of-safely cross. We've done some charity work on the other side of the city, as its really needed and the human suffering can't be described. All 3 of us have been traveling for 5-10 years and we really thought we'd seen it all. Yet we've never come across such difference: the suffering is next to the luxury and the poor basically sleep on the parking sports where rich people can't even leave their car (cause it will be stolen).  The food is amazing, the people are nice, the country is beautiful, its very cheap to live a very good life here, yet I would never recommend this place to any young woman traveling without a male partner or friend.

My favourite upscale place to eat was FARM restaurant, which is a gem of a resto located in the beginning of Tallinn's Old Town.

It has all of the convivences one could expect from the city except for an MRT system which as of September 2022, they are in the middle of building one anyway. Things are affordable although I have noticed a tamer street food scene compared to other places in Vietnam like Hanoi. Seems to be making more room for higher end dining but affordability is still easy. HCMC without a doubt has some great nightlife, so party animals are going to be very happy here. I am sure those willing to use grab or even rent a motorbike may find even more affordability outside of District 1.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "How the f is this city in the #1 spot for europe? Is the Warsaw city council paying for the spot?  I spent a month here mostly to help during the ukraine refugee crisis. This was the most meh city I've visited in my life. People are incredibly cold. They have this attitude (I was about to write slavic, but actually I've been to other slavic countries and they've been really friendly, so I don't want to bunch them together) kind of a cold indifference, but you can never tell if they're purposefully being an jerk either. Kind of like a big city attitude without having any of the actual benefits of a real big city to back it up. Like every adult is stuck in angsty teenager mode. There definitely is no customer service, but again, it's not that they are being difficult, they really just don't care. Example:  Went to 3 diff coworking spaces and none of them got back to me about doing a tour. So I spent a whole day physically going to the 3, then picking the least standoffish one (HUBHUB). The receptionist gave me a contract starting on Friday, I paid for a 24/7 access accnt, but I couldn't get my keys till Monday, so wasting the 1st weekend, and I kept bringing up payment and kept being told in the future. They never ended up charging me.   The caveat is that this city DID take in a million refugees without blinking an eye and everyone has shown much charity to all the newcomers. So deep down, they are actually incredibly good people. And there is a lot of classical music w/ free chopin concerts. That was the one redeeming factor for me. Also it was cheap. But I don't mind paying slightly more to not live in an unfriendly snoozefest.",

City is relatively safe but you'll occasionally get harassed by beggars which can create a feeling of unease. Food is very meh, the best restaurants are the turkish/greek over the traditional \"serbian\" ones. Locals are generally nice and welcoming even if you're from the US, but the youth are obnoxious and loud especially at night. The smoking especially in indoor buildings is rude and obnoxious to most but not in Serbian culture.  Overall I would say 5/10. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "The city is quite pleasant. There are some good streets to walk. It never feels crowded, except the most touristic areas.  Architecture is interesting (but nothing to write home about) in a small touristic area, outside of it it's mostly ugly Soviet-era apartment blocks and ramshackle small houses. A couple of years ago the city was cheap, but now it's more expensive than many European cities and Asian capitals. When it was cheap, it was nice to stay there despite its drawbacks. Now it is very questionable. Drawbacks: - locals are somewhat unfriendly, nationalistic to quite high degree - they can either love you or hate you for nothing, and it happens in seconds - they drive like hell - food is the same in most places (though tasty) - low quality of everything: service, accomodations, goods etc. I'd say asian quality at european prices. I also didn't find the nature around Tbilisi particularly exciting. There is some beautiful nature in the country but it's far away from the capital.",

The old outages are referring to the load shedding issue which were routine power outages for the majority of the day.  Now power outages are not routine and can last unknown amounts of time, even the main (and only) airport loses power often.  Buildings are unheated, water for showering is generally unheated or lukewarm, many houses get their water from urban aquifers which may be heavily polluted, as city water is yellow and oily.  Many roads in the city are dirt, and air quality is extremely poor, especially during the crop burning season.  Locals are friendly and helpful and many outside of tourist areas may have never met a foreigner before.  The locals and the mountains make the place special, everything else about it is quite bad, notably hygiene, food safety, traffic danger, and exposure to all sorts of environmental pollutants.  That said, I will be returning to visit the local friends made while there.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Beautiful island. For me it hits a sweet spot combining some of Canggu and Ubud. There's good stuff like breath work and ecstatic dance close by but you don't have to scooter a whole hour to get there. It's not too hippy and you can easily avoid that vibe if you're not into it. The mountainous landscape makes for some lovely scootering - so nice that I've taken a few rides just for the pleasure of it. The bigger roads are lit at night and pretty good, not much traffic.   Compared to Bali many restaurants are bit more basic with uncomfortable bamboo chairs and the same Thai menus (but great food). There are also good modern/western restaurants but not too many.    Main downside is that there's no really good coworking space. There is Remote&Digital (several locations), High Life has one, BeachHut. None of them is conducive to a community I find. There are regular nomad meetups though and there are whatsapp groups.    The pro/con review below also sums it up quite well, but here are two updates: - there's food delivery now (phangan-delivery dot com). Takes about 60 minutes (I got used to that) and works well - electricity is stable, no blackouts in 3 months (except one after a powerful storm that got fixed quickly)  I also enjoy that there are Thai people coming to Phangan for what it has to offer and it's nice chatting with them.",

Nomad scene is here with a couple of Meetups and Activities if you look for it. It's relative cheap compare to West Europe. Food is difficult to find Restaurants what you can eat well.   Pros: Weather always perfect even in winter  It's an Island, so there are many beaches  2 Airports with many flights all over Europe   Fresh Fruits and Vegetable as many things grow here.  Cons: If you are a foodie its difficult to find any good food what is not Spanish or Italian  Even the Bus System is really good they need to improve with walkways or bike roads, but this is a problem in all over Spain.  Order online is a gamble sometimes is fast but as the Canary Islands are outside the European customs union you have to declare goods what the value us over 15o EUR ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Seseh is a small, beachy area north of Canggu. It's not really a community of its own, although that's changing as people move north from being priced out of the Canggu Airbnb market.  Seseh is built mostly on \"green land\", or land zoned for nature use rather than commercial or residential use. For this reason, land is scarce and rentals are quite expensive, with some Airbnb properties exceeding $6000 USD/mo.   There is an enclave of expensive Airbnbs next to Seseh Beach which has nice homes. Good for a well-to-do family. Not worth it if you're single, as you will be quite isolated here and you'll need to drive ~25 minutes to get to Canggu proper.  WiFi speeds are slow and wifi coverage can be spotty. Don't recommend if you need low latency for your work.  Not a lot going on at night or during the day here. It's very quiet. Not a lot of shops, restaurants, or things to do other than the beach. You're a bit too far for Gojek delivery from Canggu restaurants.  4/10 for digital nomads 8/10 for families with kids who want a big property and beach access. ",

But the food is amazing, cost of living is cheap, and the parks and mountains surrounding you make it worth visiting! You can literally hike a gorgeous mountain walking about 5 minutes south of the old city center. It's also the most central location to visit nearby castles and national parks. You can buy tickets online and the trains are easy to navigate to get to places like Peles Castle in an hour or so. Highly recommend staying here a couple weeks! I hope to return.",

It's a bit of an older vibe than Canggu, and there's certainly a big chunk of yogi's kicking around ‚Äî but I liked it much better than Canggu and found it less pretentious. Plus, you can drive down there in 45mins whenever you want some beach or party vibes.   As others mentioned, there's some great coworking spaces, cheap warungs, some really nice spots to stay cheaply if you go just outside of the mad touristy areas like Hanoman/Monkey Forest/Penestan.  You're definitely going to want a scooter, and you'll learn quickly which roads to avoid at what times because the traffic can be pretty crazy ‚Äî but that's true for Canggu as well.  It's green and lush, there's great food and a handful of good bars, lots of great pools and chillout spots, good yoga and gyms, and you're within 45mins ride of the beach, waterfalls, and jungles. Pretty damn good in my books.",

You have to carry cash around and lots of bills as worth 1/40th of what they were a few years ago. You can't really use cards anywhere, except dollar ATMs and some supermarkets.  Electricity mostly from generators, which have downtime a few hours a day. You need to check the daily hours of supply for the building before booking a place. 4G internet good 30+Mbps. Wired internet variable. Local SIM, I got a Touch Lebanon one with 20GB data for about $25/month. Pricier if you buy at the airport. Airport close to city centre. $10-15 taxi fare. Uber and Bolt work but you must assign payment as cash and it will be more than the app says, because of the high downward volatility of the LBP currency. Some classier cafes or restaurants will take USD notes but mostly you need LBP.  Heaps of culture and history. Heaps of street art. A heartful people who have suffered insanely but still keep going, shows you the power of the human spirit to survive and thrive.  I like the place and will be back in summer.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Semiyak was my refuge from the crazy traffic, massive western crowds, mosquito attacks, and inflated prices of Canggu. Seminyak is not 'Balifornia' (Canguu), some will like it for that reason alone.   Traffic can get clogged in Seminyak but it's still far better than Canggu. Seminyak is just as commercialized as Canggu, but in a different way. If you're familiar with NY, Canggu has east village or lower east side vibes, while Seminyak is more soho.   Of course neither comes close to the actual NY neighborhoods. You could say Seminyak  is more polished with better infrastructure, so you'll find more sidewalks and high end artisan shops, while Canggu is like a super westernized village. Both areas are full of tourists, expats, and nomads, so you'll find plenty of good co working spaces, vegan cafes, and good coffee in Seminyak.  If you're trying to avoid mosquitos (and the gekkos they bring), there are definitely less in some parts of Seminyak, due to the infrastructure being more built up, although you still need to use repellent. Be alert to Seminyak scammers, they will spot you from a mile if you're western.  Thankfully my NY skills made it easy to avoid and/or get rid of them. Seminyak has some of the best beachfront bars and cafes, with pools overlooking the sea, better than what you find in Canggu. Don't get me wrong, I still love Canggu, just not thrilled with what it's become, and Seminyak provides an escape that's just a grab or scooter ride away.  If you decide to check out Seminyak you need to dig to find the gems. Because on the surface it's pretty typical, but once you discover some of the amazing places there, you can create your own hideaway. It took me a few days and many hours of research, by foot and online, to find the best hidden places of Seminyak. Prices are better than Canggu but again, you need to dig a bit.",

Davao City is only boring if you don't know where to go, and as someone who lives outside of Davao, I find myself coming back more than five times a year for the people, the culture it has, and how conveniently close it is to beautiful vacation places.

But it was dirty, drunks(just peeing on the street was a nice sight) and beggars on the streets. Was also very unlucky with the food I took in some resturants/cafes. (expensive and below average taste/portion size).  Street food was actually good. I did see many people speaking English around the center so definitely there are tourists there. Nightlife- quite expensive, tourist fees for entrance to the bars by security guards. For me it seemed strange that parties happens extremely late at nigh (3:00 AM when it was most crowded and I was already heading home.) Rented a car and outside of Sofia I found the country to be more authentic with beautiful mountains etc. I suggest skipping Sofia as a nomad and going to Varna instead. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Where cowboys and the wild west truly started, San Antonio is a beautiful and historic city with many layers to explore within and outside the city. It's a hotter town than Austin, not just in temperature, but also in terms of friendliness, activities, family values, and cultural richness (with authentic tacos of all types, Tex-Mex, Cali style, and from Mexico City), it has one of the best culinary and cocktail scenes in the country. It's one of the most affordable for millennials in the States with rich multicultural diversity, being predominantly Hispanic and inclusive. Many are bilingual in Spanish, but English is predominant as anywhere else in the States. From aviation (first military flight) to tech (the invention of the microprocessor), and even Hollywood (the first Best Picture), San Antonio has been home to many firsts. The spirit of these firsts has continued through the ages. Nowadays, there are incredibly fast internet speeds thanks to Google Fiber in many parts of town, San Antonio has all the ingredients for a booming creative economy due to a convergence of incentives in film, gaming, and traditional arts. Downtown San Antonio has old Spanish-architecture, mixed with colorful murals by local artists, and southern Texan charm, but it's the beautiful people who really make the town flourish. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I'm Polish and I've been to Gda≈Ñsk a number of times over the course of the last 10 years. When I was younger and have seen and experienced less, I was very impressed by the old town. However, these days, after having seen most of Europe and some of the US, I can't help but feel that Gdansk's old town is small and everything that surrounds it has a distinct, post-communist feel, which I do not enjoy. I was there this summer (2022) and it felt like being in an amusement park, with many of the apartment complexes around the old town turning into cheap, short stay aparthotels. The place felt empty due to that. The biggest allure of the city is that it is so close to the sea. Unfortunately, as locals would tell you, it is extremely crowded when the weather is nice, therefore most locals avoid the sea in the summer, which to me sounds weird. Considering the climate, I wouldn't want to be near that sea outside of the summer time!  To end this review on a more positive note, I think the city is well connected with the municipal rail making all parts accessible. It is very green outside of the old town and the air quality is the best among largest Polish cities. For foreigners, I think Gda≈Ñsk is a must see and as other commenters here noted, it's a good place to nomad from.",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Taxis in Istanbul are a big problem even for locals. Public transport is convenient and comfortable. If you need to call a taxi, I recommend using an app. \"Bitaksi\" can be used. Agree with the taxi driver using google translate and negotiate in advance if necessary. Always make public transportation your first choice.  There are millions of refugees in this city against a registered population of 15 million. A significant number of asylum seekers do not have any registered documents and this creates various problems, so beware.  Nightlife is not recommended in Taksim. It is recommended that you prefer places such as Kadƒ±k√∂y or Be≈üikta≈ü, Sarƒ±yer.  Some of the foreign women I met said that they felt very safe in this city. This surprised me because I don't think so. But local young women are very sensitive and can always help you. If you are a friendly person, you will not have a hard time making friends.  As a negative feature, I can say that house rents are high.  You should prefer places that are more familiar to tourists. I can recomend Kadƒ±k√∂y.  A substantial portion of university students have English.  You can have great food and wander around one of the oldest cities in history. There are great cafes in √úsk√ºdar, Bakƒ±rk√∂y, Kadƒ±k√∂y and Balat. Especially Balat is a nice place.",

There are a bunch of expats here, and a lot them are involved in social projects. If you're looking to do something good beyond experiencing a country, it's a good place to start.  WiFi is totally usable everywhere. Mobile data is cheap and fast.  Siem Reap has tons of options for food and drinks. It's very easy to get around or foot/bike now because they built a new, fit for purpose road with a CYCLE LANE all along the river.  I disagree that's there's not much to do - there's plenty in and around the city. The circus for me is a must-see. Angkor Wat is obviously amazing - take a bicycle because you get more out of it. Definitely go and see Apopo - they train rats to find landmines and it's such a good initiative. I liked the lotus farm too.   Places to stay - would recommend the Bygone. You could easily live there for a month. The owners are super chilled and friendly. They're also using the business to support charity so totally worthwhile. ",

The leisure activities outside Munich (nature) are nice, unfortunately there is not much going on in the city compared to London, Berlin or Barcelona.

Plenty of authentic Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese options for about 50% of what you would pay in a Western city.  Decent hostels will cost $11-$15 weekdays and between $18-$30 on weekends....  Good internet; beautiful architecture and people but it is true Hungarians can be very cold at times.  Overall a good stay with many destinations just a quick and cheap flight/train ride away (Bratislava/Belgrade/Vienna,Bucharest/Sofia/Prague and several Polish cities .",

    "descriptionFromReview": "Mauritius is indeed a great place to live in as a Digital Nomad ! They have recently released the Premium Visa for digital nomads that allows to live on the island for at least 1 year (renewable). Best places to live in are the North (very well developed with all facilities and business centres) and the West of the island (more for those who prefer to surf the waves and hike the mountains in between 2 video calls !).   The Mauritians are very welcoming and smiling people. I am not the first one to be touched deeply by their generosity. Food is very nice, people are helping, music and culture are the best. Wind in the South is perfect for kite surfing, wind foil, windsurf, etc  There are also new coworking spaces opening all around the island and you can hop from The Hive coworking spaces to a nice South African caf√© such as Bloom in the North or to a tea place/colonial house such as Les Aubineaux in the centre of the island. All with nice wifi and great vibes.   My personal recommendations : visit the tea factory of Bois Cheri, taste the Vanilla Rum of Saint-Aubin, hop in the beautiful lagoon of Pointe d'Esny, and hike Le Morne at sunrise. I cherish every single one of these visits.    I would also recommend to be accompanied by an agency to get your visa, find a trusted real estate agency, choose your local insurance, etc. I asked Smart Traveller, they are specialised in helping digital nomads come settle in Mauritius and they were the best. Young and friendly team, professional and human. Cannot recommend them enough actually.   Still a great adventure to be here in Mauritius working remotely and a dream come true for my family and I.

    "descriptionFromReview": "I've been in Phuket for about a month now. Most of that time I've spent in Ka Ron and Kata beach area, but also have been to Chalong, Pa Tong, Rawai, and Kathu.   Karon and Kata beaches are my favorite. Beaches are beautiful, especially Karon. Overall most everything is reasonably priced, but not the bargain I was told it is. I eventually found a hotel I like, where I pay 12-13 euro per night (below 500 baht atm) and that is by far the lowest I found for the quality I expect. Considering the location (close to the beach), internet connectivity, room size, quality of amenities, and the staff, it is a very good deal. However, most hotels I have been to were just lacking. It's hard to find one that has a desk suitable for work in the room. Internet is a hit or miss at best. You would think with fiberoptic cables on each pole every place would have amazing internet, but it's not that simple. Hotels being hotels, sometimes you have to go through bullshit complimentary wifi logins, which expire at random times etc. I am not the coffee shop nomad type, but even that seems to not quite work in the areas I visited - I've seen some coffee places, but they are quite empty. It's off season still, I am being told. Come October, we shall see.   Another poster mentioned that the vibe is \"not there yet\". I think it's fair to say the vibe is \"no longer here\". Most everything strikes me as old and barely maintained. The vast majority of hotels, restaurants, and coffee places I have either visited or considered reek of late 90s/early 2000s at best. A dangerous combination considering how humid it can get here.   Touts are very annoying and some of them are either desperate or simply stupid. Some of them I pass 3-4 times a day, they definitely remember me and they will still yell at me \"TUK TUK!\" or \"CUSTOM MADE SUIT!\". At one point I got so annoyed that I asked the guy if he is going to ask me about the damn suit every single time he sees me and he used that as an opportunity to offer it to me again. It's even more annoying with \"massage parlours\" (i.e. brothels), especially if you are a man. I guess you just have to learn to treat them like air. I find it hard, because when somebody greets me or waves at me it is natural for me to wave back or respond and that's all they need to feel invited to sell harder.   Another poster mentioned prostitution. Yes, it's here and it's hard to miss. You may want to not notice it, but it sure as hell will notice you. In general, the more party oriented the place, the more \"freelancers\" are around. Pa Tong was very bad in this regard. I would strongly advise against going there unless you have a particular business to attend to, e.g. extending your visa. Most massage parlours are simply brothels, but not all. I think it's quite easy to tell the difference. For one, workers at a genuine massage parlour will not be overly exposing themselves. Some will add \"no sex\" on their banners. In general, the more professional the place looks the higher the chance it's not a brothel. Of course, nobody will force you to get a happy ending, you can get just the massage, but if it's at a brothel the quality of service will be low since it's not really what they are there to sell.   But enough of complaining. Let's mention the good bits.    The food is great, easily accessible, and cheap. Not as cheap as street food in the normie-local parts of Bangkok (everything is touristy here), but still very cheap compared to anywhere in Europe or the US. In general, I find that the more crude and local the place looks, the cheaper and better the food is. Even better, a local grill stall that opens up very early and closes shortly after 1PM - clearly there to feed locals going to work in the morning. The worst meals I had were served in \"food and live music\" places clearly catering to tourists and those were severely overpriced too (still cheap compared to Europe, but apples to apples...)   People are very nice, carefree, smiling, welcoming, and chatty. Of course they don't have the easiest of lives, but they seem not to excessively worry about it. I like Thais, they are very warm and kind (unless they drive tuk tuks or sell custom made suits, though some of the latter seem to be Indians). I smile at them and they always smile back, something that's not so common in some parts of the world. It's quite amazing how much can be discussed with gestures, pointing at things, and smiling. Don't expect English proficiency anywhere on the island, with rare exceptions and those do come with heavy accent too. I mention it because some people, like me, may find the accent very hard to understand.   It's clean. There is no litter on the streets or beaches. I did see some plastic bags/cups/other items in the ocean, but it's been infrequent and it doesn't accumulate on the shore. It is clear there is an effort to keep the place clean. Coming from a very clean country, I appreciate that a lot and it makes me respect the locals even more. I don't think this is specific to Phuket. I had the same impression in Bangkok. Considering the climate and population density, things could have been so much worse and yet they aren't.   Overall, I am glad I came here and I may stay a little longer. Will probably come back. I can see myself visiting regularly, but not sure if I could live here. At the end of the day, English proficiency is way too low and I am not convinced I have enough motivation to learn Thai.",

In about ten days it will quit down as people return  to work and school.  Overall I'm enjoying the vibe and Internet is good. I read they fixed the sewage problem that other reviewers have mentioned. I will post another review after a few weeks.  I was speaking to a local and he said rent for a basic apartment is max $300 and you can purchase one for about 25k (60 sq meters two bedroom)",

BUT the situation with food is very complicated, is hard to find literally anything, there are queues everywhere. The internet is expensive (2.5 GB of LTE for 8 dollars) and very unstable. If you don't need so much internet to your work and if you are patient enough, you can enjoy Havana as it is really interesting and unique city.",

Lots of travelers here are smoking weed, it seems to be pretty legal here. internet speeds are good (probably 15 up and down on average but I stayed in one place that was hitting 30) but power cuts are frequent in the summer (monsoon) months. Many hotels, guest houses, airbnbs are fitted with an inverter to combat this (which basically means one or two sockets and lights in the place will still work during a power cut, so make sure your place has an inverter and your modem is plugged into one of the working sockets. No co-working spaces available in Pokhara at this time. Overall I'd definitely recommend it but the inverter is a must! If you are doing research about Pokhara and you are worried about load shedding, rest assured it doesn't happen anymore (just be aware of the power outages in the monsoon months).",

The mountains on the west side of the city seem to just explode out of the ocean and it's special to see. That said, the built environment is pretty uninspiring. The center of the city is full of interesting restaurants and shops, but outside of the old town it's not very exciting to look at. My primary complaint, however, is on public transit. It's easy to use the tram to get to/from the airport and bus station, but outside of those destinations you better be ready to walk (or use a cab, which I try to never do). Wifi was solid but I did have some drops here and there, my apartment was decent, and the city felt pretty safe. It's also incredibly cheap. I tend to be very frugal, so take this with a grain of salt, but you can easily get a quality meal for about $4 US and would have no problem getting an awesome meal for $8 US. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't have wanted to stay much longer than the two weeks I was there.",

I wouldn't say the locals are \"friendly to a fault\" and mostly have left me alone.   Yes, the old town city center is dirty, garbage on the sidewalks and streets are a common sight. Traffic is chaotic but I never found it a nightmare, no worse than other SE Asian cities I've been to. I wasn't really prepared nor never liked how \"cash only\" heavy Hanoi is, even higher end cocktail lounges don't accept cards.",

There‚Äôs not much traffic, beaches are amazing, there‚Äôs a significant Brazilian/Portuguese community around which reflects in ethnic restaurants pretty good and affordable. Surf culture is present, so the laid back lifestyle. Maybe it‚Äôs hard to find an actual ‚Äúhome‚Äù, I always prefer to stay in cheap guesthouses such as 3D Homestay, with a nice swimming pool. Enjoy the morning in the beach and catch the unforgettable sunsets (don‚Äôt miss Uluwatu Temple!), get the work done by noon when it‚Äôs too hot to get outside.",

It's very resorty and there's some horrific tourist hellholes like 'Grandworld' which is an imitation world that is monstrously large and destroying the island.  However, there are some really good restaurants. Inland you can find some nice hiking spots and viewpoints (they're not easy to find). The waterfalls are nice if you hike further up them away from the piles of trash left by the locals.   We stayed at Phu Quoc ecolodge which was stunning and really a good place to work. Good WiFi, provide free and delicious tea all day and such a good range of drinks. Also kikicoconut would be nice to stay at - was our other option and we got to know the owner.  I'd say it's worth going to if you're in Vietnam and fancy going to an island. Just avoid staying in a resort.",

For the most part, it's orientated around suburbian living. The main city (Johannesburg CBD) is for the most part a no-go because of crime, but if you know some locals you should definitely check it out there are amazing restaurants, theatres and museums to experience there.   Having lived here for 30+ years, I'd recommend checking out Sandton CBD, restaurants in Linden, Wanderers and Bryanston, and  rent a car to drive out to The Cradle of Humankind, and visit the Maropeng museum there. There is a lot to do here, you just need to think and act like a local.   If you are travelling to Johannesburg, I also feel like you'd be doing yourself a diss service by not planning a trip to The Kruger National Park. ",

    "descriptionFromReview": "I have grown up in Tampa Bay and can give some quick insight.   If you want to genuinely experience the overall area or its history you'll want to visit both Ybor City and St Petersburg (First two areas that were initially settled). Clearwater is a tourist trap but has a beautiful manufactured beach (the sand as imported to make this beach what it is today).   Saint Petersburg, FL:  St Petersburg offers a few co-working spaces and at one time boasted the largest number of Kava Bars in a given city in the US (which are often used as cowork space by locals). The Brewery scene in St Petersburg is unmatched, with over 50 different breweries located in Pinellas County alone.   Nightlife: EDM/Dance Music is primarily seen in Tampa/Ybor City especially for harder genres like Dubstep/Riddim and Drum & Bass, as well as Tech House. However, St Petersburg has a reputation for being the more artistic side of the Tampa Bay area and thus has a strong community for Techno and House music.   Daytime Fun: - Kayaking through the mangroves in Lido Key (Day trip) - 'Hiking' in Weedon Island Preserve - Daytime in Ybor City (great restaurants, bars, and a bit of history) - Busch Gardens Theme Park (Excellent rollercoasters) - Art walk in St Pete - Dali Museum (St Pete) - Fort Desoto  Cons: -5 years ago Tampa Bay was extremely affordable by all accounts, but is currently pacing to become much more expensive with a 25% increase in housing costs in the last year alone and one of the highest overall inflation rates in the country. -Traveling around Tampa Bay can become expensive due to the physical size of the city and how scattered things can be. Public transit is not worth the money saved, but if you're remaining in one area, Uber is very reasonably priced.  -There are a lot of people from other cities in the US moving into Tampa Bay, so there are many people that are not a reflection of the locals here.",
